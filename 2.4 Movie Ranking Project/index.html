<hr />

<h3>Superman by James Gunn</h3>
<p>Arguably one of the best depictions of Superman, and takes great inspiration from his characterization from the comic books.</p>

<h3>How To Train Your Dragon</h3>
<p>The movie that made me excited to fly, and honestly has the most interesting dragon designs of all time.</p>

<h3>Guardians of the Galaxy 3</h3>
<p>Honestly, I wasnt the biggest fan for the second movie, but the third movie was just so raw, emotional and makes you care more about the lives of the other characters who arent Quinn. And, I might even say because of this movie, I like Rocket way more than Quinn.</p>
